WordReference Translator
========================

Open a new tab with WordReference&#39;s translation for the selected word. How:
* Through a floating link (when double clicking on the word)
<!-- * Through context menu "Translate"
* Through Firefox's global menu "Tools"

You can [install WordReference Translator on Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wordreference-translator/). -->

On the settings page you can choose translation for the supported extension languages and for translations supported by WordReference: Spanish, English and Portuguese. Other languages may be added later on.

Based on [sanoodles/wrtranslator](https://github.com/sanoodles/wrtranslator). As the old XUL format is no longer supported in Firefox Quantum, I've made a new version based on the previous one that only works by double clicking words so far.

Not implemented yet or entirely:
- Context menu.
- Navbar button popup.
- Floating link timeout.
- Keyboard shortcut.

Not going to be implemented:
- Thunderbird version.

Try it out!
