You can [install WordReference Translator on Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/word-reference-translator/).

On the settings page you can choose translation for the supported addon languages and for translations supported by WordReference: Spanish, English, French, Italian, German and Portuguese. Other languages may be added later on.

Based on [sanoodles/wrtranslator](https://github.com/sanoodles/wrtranslator). As the old XUL format is no longer supported in Firefox Quantum, I've made a new version using WebExtensions API.

Not implemented yet or entirely:
- Navbar button popup.
- Floating link timeout.

Not going to be implemented:
- Thunderbird version.
